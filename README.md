# **dbsPatients**
**Idea**
This repository is part of my university internship project. The idea was developed by my supervisor 
Dr. David Pedrosa (dpedrosac), who is the senior physician in charge of the department Parkinson and 
Neuromodulation. In the above listed files are all patients included whom underwent a surgery called 
Deep Brain Stimula-tion (DBS) in the Department of Neurology at the University Hospital of Gießen and 
Marburg. This surgery is a very important step to help patients that suffer from different diseases 
like Parkin-son’s, Dystonia or Essential Tremor. Patients are selected if they have:

inconspicuous tests (psychiatric, neuropsychological, logopedic)
neurosurgical evaluation
X-Ray picture of the thorax
sonography of the abdomen
OP-capability
MRI in order to exclude chirurgical contraindications
If the diagnosis is idiopathic Parkinson syndrome there are further indication criteria: DBS is used 
if the disease is already in an advanced stage (currently in discussion) and when their motor 
fluctuations and dyskinesia or their tremor cannot be treated with medication anymore. Another 
important criterion is a positive response of the symptoms to Levodopa. If the patient suffers from 
dystonia or essential tremor, then DBS could be a treatment, if the symptoms cannot be treated anymore 
with medication.

Usage
These files are an overview of all different patients whom underwent DBS surgery in the clinic in the 
last few years. Therefore, it is possible to exchange important information’s as well as compare 
suc-cesses between institutions in different countries. With this method we get an opportunity to 
learn more about these diseases and also about the surgery in order to achieve improvements. 
Currently there are a lot of different studies that show different diseases that could be highly 
improved with DBS (e.g. Tourette, Depression, Schizophrenia). Furthermore, you can always update the 
files with new information (patient, tests, knowledge). If you have access to the patient-website 
(ORBIS) at the University Hospital of Gießen and Marburg, then you can directly open the corresponding 
patient information card.

Repository structure
All important patient information are described in the three csv files: Preoperative.csv, 
Intraopera-tive.csv and Postoperative.csv. Actually there is a fourth csv file “general_data.csv”, 
which is only avail-able to the employees of the hospital. They consist of all the different data 
about the patient:

medication before, while and after the surgery
the diagnosis
different test results (like Hoehn and Yahr or UPDRS III)
surgery date
electrode placement
improvements after the surgery
etc.
In order to receive these information, there are different GUI's. As the name suggests GUI_Preoperative 
is for the Preoperative.csv file and so on. Furthermore, there is a GUI called "GUIcheckPID", which can be used to check if a patient is already in the general data csv file. PID is a special code which is used within the ORBIS system in the neurology department. If the PID is already existent then it opens the "GUIgeneral_data" file and searches for the string. Otherwise one need to input a new entry. “GUI_Start” is a GUI that opens “GUI_Main” when the button is pressed. GUI_Main is responsible to open further GUI’s (Preoperative, Intraoperative and Postoperative).

If you have further questions, feel free to contact me any time. I am always open for feedback or new 
ideas! You can contact me on the GitHub website of the project or via email 
(krothm@students.uni-marburg .de).

Acknowledgements
First of all, I want to thank my supervisor Dr. David Pedrosa for the support and help throughout this 
project. It was a very challenging but also enjoyable internship and I am very grateful for this 
experi-ence. Last but not least I want to thank all the staff in the hospital who assisted me.
